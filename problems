1. Write a program that takes co-eeficents of quadratic equations for form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and prints the roots of equation. If the roots of equation are euqal then it prints
   roots are equal as show below.
   
   Example exections:
   
   Enter a, b, and c in same ordder : 1, -7, 12
   Root 1 : 3
   Root 2 : 4
   
    Enter a, b, and c in same ordder : 1, -1, 1
    Root 1 and 2 and equal : 1


2. Write a program that Celcius to Fareheit conversion. It will ask the user which way cnonversion to be done "C->F" or "F->C". Then it asks for relevant input and then 
show the appropiate result.

   Eample:
     
    Which way conversion you wish to perform : F->C
    Enter Temperature in Farenhiet : 32
    32 F in Celcius is 0
    
    Which way conversion you wish to perform : C->F
    Enter Temperature in Farenhiet : 0
    0 C in Farheneit is 32
